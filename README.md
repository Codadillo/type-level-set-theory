## Some Set Theory Using Rust's Type System
An exploration of the power and Turing-completeness of Rust's type system. Leverages the language's polymorphism (generics) and the resultant unification (trait solving) to automatically prove various facts about set theory from axioms. This repository mostly focuses on implementing the set-theoretic definition of the natural numbers.
